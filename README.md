## Unbiased Functional Dependencies
Mining functional dependencies in the wild is prone to significant biases.
The reason is that these algorithms can only find a (usually proper) subset of the actual functional dependencies.
These subsets are significantly affected by specific biases, if for example most of the data comes from a single source.
For example, a financial database that contains information about gender, might be affected by
societal biases when imputing missing income information. 

This is true for any functional dependencies mining algorithm, and in particular for TANE.
In this project, I modify the TANE algorithm by using an LLM to indicate whether a discovered functional dependency 
is biased.
Then, I first use unbiased FDs for imputation, and only if there are still NULL values,
I use the biased FDs, balancing their (biased) imputation distribution.
